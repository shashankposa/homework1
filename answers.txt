What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge is when a contributer compares the commit history of a branch against that of another branch and creates a merge commit, effectively combining the two branches.  A rebase is when a contributer adds the commits of a branch on top of main, effectively rewriting main's commit history and eliminating the need for a merge commit.
